## 1.2 - Principles in Exercise Physiology

- Exercise - Heart rate increases and blood vessels dilate. These make sure your muscles get the stuff.
- If you habitually overload a system, it will respond and adapt.
- There is a chronic adaptation with higher endurance training.
- Specificity - only the system/body part will adapt. Strength training will not increase your mitochondria.
- Reversibility - inactivity will return to the baseline.
- Individuality - precise responses vary among individuals.

## 1.3 - Calorimetry & Oxygen Consumption

- Heat production - one's metabolic rest both at rest and during exercise
- Indirect calorimetry - measures O2 consumption, not heat, metabolic rate.
- V.O2 - max oxygen consumption - using a graded test, to exhaustion, until the individual fatigues, and can go no further
- As you become more aerobically fit from endurance training, your ability to transport, deliver and utilize oxygen for energy production is enhanced. Thus, the maximal rate in which you can consume oxygen reflects these beneficial cardiovascular adaptations.
- **Respiratory exchange ratio** - CO2 produced/O2 consumed - pure fat is 0.7, pure carb is 1.

## 1.4 - ATP & Muscular Work

- Needed to supply the energy needs when moving from rest to exercise.
- ATP is the only compound that can be used directly for muscle contraction.
- With intense exercise, the ATP (utilised) can be higher than the ATP your body can produce.
- ATP production

- Mitochondria - ATP production - these must be activated to supply energy when doing exercise.
- Aerobic
- Anaerobic - need immediate sources in muscle (ATP and creatine phospate).

- Carb - can be broken down both anareobic and aerobic.
- Aerobic - needs oxygen.
- For the same glucose molecule, we get 15 times more O2 if we break it down aerobically, not anaerobically.

## 1.5 - Carbohydrate Metabolism During Exercise

- Stored in muscle and liver.
- Glycogen - strings of carbs put together.
- The major function of muscle glycogen is to supply glucose units for muscle energetics.  The major function of liver glycogen is to maintain blood glucose levels, which is critical as during exercise muscle extracts glucose from the blood for fuel.
- Finally the total amount of energy available in the form of carbohydrate in the body is approximately 2000 Kilocalories in an average 154 Pound individual. This brings up an extremely important point, this is not a lot of energy. There is only a limited amount of carbohydrate stored, and thus, carbohydrates can and will deplete during prolonged distance exercise, as well as high-intensity exercise of sufficient duration. Let's compare the amount of carbohydrate stored in the body with that for fats. In the same 154 pound individual, there is well over 100,000 kilocalories of energy in our fat stores. That's 50 times more than that found for carbohydrates. There is no threat of depleting our fat stores during a single bout of exercise. As we will see a key endurance or aerobic training adaptation is the ability to use fats as fuel to a greater extent, thereby preserving our precious carbohydrate stores. There are many factors that influence the degree and extent to which we use carbohydrate store in a single bout of exercise. Of these, the exercise intensity and duration, have the greatest impact. Shown here is a graded exercise test to maximal oxygen uptake or VO2 max.
- As intensity is low, fats are the preferred fuel.

- Glucose/glycolysis.
	- The activation of key enzymes in the pathways of glycogenolysis and glycolysis are regulated by multiple factors including hormones, intramuscular calcium levels, and the energy charge in working muscles.
- High intensity - Type 2 muscle fibers.
- Second, at high exercise intensities, as mentioned earlier in this video, we will predominantly be recruiting our Type Il muscle fibers, which rely more heavily on carbohydrates than fats for fuel. Now let's look at the other extreme. The easy workload at approximately 31% of max. Notice that the rate of glycogen muscle depletion is significantly lower. This can be explained by one, a lower rate of ATP utilization at this workload. And two, a greater reliance on fats as a fuel source as per the crossover concept. And three, a greater improvement of our Type I muscle fibers which have the capacity to use glycogen and glucose aerobically, thereby slowing the rate of carbohydrate utilization.
### Summary

- Carbohydrates are a major fuel used by working muscles.
- The exercise intensity and fiber type recruitment are major factors determining CHO utilization.
- There is a limited amount of CHO stored in the human body.
- The activation of glycogenolysis and glycolysis are regulated by multiple factors (hormones, intramuscular Ca++ levels, and the energy charge).
